# Analysis-of-UK-NHS-Hospital-Database
This repository contains an analysis of the UK NHS (National Health Service) Hospital Database, including geospatial data.
An appropriate title for this data analysis file could be "Analysis of UK NHS Hospital Database".

Here's a standard README file for this Python notebook:

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the `hospital.csv` file, which contains information about hospitals in the UK, including their names, locations, contact details, organizational types, and sectors.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed using Python and various data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The following analyses are included:

1. **Distribution of Hospitals by Sector**: Visualizes the distribution of hospitals across different sectors (NHS and non-NHS) using a pie chart.
2. **NHS Hospitals Managed through PIMS**: Analyzes the distribution of NHS hospitals managed through the Patient Information Management System (PIMS).
3. **Distribution of Hospitals across UK Regions**: Explores the distribution of hospitals across different regions of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) using pie charts, bar plots, and line plots.
4. **Geographic Visualization of Hospitals**: Creates an interactive map with markers representing the locations of hospitals.
5. **Availability of Contact Information**: Analyzes the availability of different contact information (phone, email, website, fax) across hospitals.
6. **Text Analysis on Hospital Names**: Performs text analysis on the hospital names to identify common naming patterns, prefixes, and suffixes.
7. **Relationship between Hospital Type and Sector**: Explores the relationship between hospital types and sectors using a contingency table and a chi-square test of independence.
8. **Geographic Location and Contact Information Availability**: Visualizes the relationship between geographic location and the availability of contact information using a scatter plot.
9. **Density of Hospitals by Geographic Location**: Visualizes the density of hospitals across different geographic locations using a hexbin plot.

## Requirements

To run this analysis, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium (for interactive maps)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn folium


## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure that the `hospital.csv` dataset is present in the `Datasets` folder.
3. Run the `NHS Dataset.py` script to generate the visualizations and analysis.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to perform additional analyses or customize the visualizations according to your requirements.
